Hello,

This Code is an inital draft for what is Required.
I created the framework from scratch, I wanted to apply and use
Java, TestNG, Maven , POM(page object model) and finally Git/Github

the Code itself needs some optimization as it doesn't apply the DRY concept ( don't repeat yourself).
But as I clarified it's just an inital draft and thankfully it works fine.
Maybe later it can be much more improved.


Thanks for Reading
Best Rgards.
